To start venv virtual machine:
$ python3 -m venv venv
$ . venv/bin/activate
run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install dependency
Then run `python main.py` to start server on local

NOTE: whenever you install a new package like "pip install flask"
you can run `pip freeze > requirements.txt` to automatically save your dependency into requirement.txt so that other members can install package in locals
